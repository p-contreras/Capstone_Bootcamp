    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is concerned with predicting a film's IMDb rating (0-10) given a select number of features.  We'll first read in the movie dataset and perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA).  After we have a solid understanding of the data, we'll clean it up and prepare it for the modelling stage.  Two models will be created for this project: a multiple linear regression model and a neural network.  The goal is to evaluate the performance of each and see which one ultimately predicts IMDb rating the best!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Producing a film is by no means an easy endeavour.  Everyone in charged of producing a new film must take into account many different variables (e.g., genre, time of year, certification) in order to minimise the risk of making a dreaded \"razzie\".  Besides revenue and profit made, one metric used by many to evaluate the success of a film is the IMDb rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to take into account several movie features (release date, language, etc.) and predict what the eventual IMDb rating will be.  By the end of this project, the model chosen should help movie producers make informed, data-driven decisions to maximise success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've defined the goal and purpose of this project, let's dive into exploring the data.  This step is responsible with gaining a good understanding of the data we'll be using and identifying issues to clean up later.  By the end of this section, we should have a good idea of what fixes we need to make to supply clean and relevant data to our models."

    "\n",
    "* The histogram for `revenue` suggests that most films in `df` don't make a revenue over 500 million (given the positive skewness of the distribution).  However, the boxplot raises a concern as it seems every point above 0.0 is considered an \"outlier\".  This is worrisome since this could mean that several films have a value of 0 for `revenue`!\n",
    "\n",
    "* `runtime` appears to have a positively skewed distribution, however, there is a concentration of data around the 100 minute mark.  The histogram shows that most films have a runtime of less than 200 minutes (3.33 hours) whereas the boxplot reveals that some films in the dataset are as long as 20 hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "* `vote_average` seems to be the feature with the least amount of skewness.  The frequency distribution appears to be unimodal with the majority of films in the dataset having an IMDb rating of around 6.2.  Around 3,000 films have a rating close to 0, however, the boxplot labels these as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unfortunately the frequency distribution for `vote_count` is barely visible due to the large frequency imbalance present.  As the histogram shows, most films have a very small `vote_count` and all other counts were labelled as \"outliers\" according to the boxplot - very strong skewness!"

Furthermore, there are also films with a `runtime` less than 45 and are considered outliers.  We'll filter `df` to include films 45 minutes or longer.
